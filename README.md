# NerCoin
A simple blockchain implementation in Java.

### Usage
Just launch the app. It will create 1000 random users, 10000 random transactions 
and apply them randomly to users. Next it will generate 1 block and append 100 
random transactions to it. Block merkel hash generation will follow after that. 
Finally a Block Miner will start which will try to mine the block.
